# CS102 ~ Personal Log page ~

## Emre TarakcÄ±


On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~  14-21/04/2020 ~
This week we created the GitHub project and I set up the initial project settings and pushed the initial commit.

### ~ 21-28/04/2020 ~
I wrote DConstructorProperty and DProperty classes and edited the rest of the classes accordingly. I also wrote the interface "Extractable", and then edited the other classes to make sure they implement extractable.
We had major problems about the merging process in github and it caused our project to corrupt, so I worked on fixing it by reverting the project to an earlier version. We divided the work among ourselves this week
and put reasonable deadlines for everyone to complete their part of the code. After that, I altered some of my teammates' codes to make sure they were compatible with my code.

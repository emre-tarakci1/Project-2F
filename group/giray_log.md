On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 14.04.2020 ~

### ~ 21.04.2020 ~
This week I added relations for the classes with every class holding its superclass 
and also extended classes with some methods.

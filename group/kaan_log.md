# CS102 ~ Personal Log page ~

## Murat Kaan Özbaş


On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 14/04/20 ~
This week I learned some more javaFX, went into documentation about Application Scene Stage etc and wrote some of my labs in FX. 

### ~ 21/04/20 ~
This week I helped with the detailed design for the logic part of our project with the rest of the team. We started writing our first pieces of code.

I wrote the DObject class. And then edited some of the other classes by adding many missing methods such as DGeneralClass methods for DProperty and DMethod fields and added toString()s to all classes. More is on the commit itself.

On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 14/04/2020 ~
We discussed the structure of the project and started to write code.
This week I wrote DInterface class.

### ~ 21/04/2020 ~
I collected all the codes and fixed the compile errors then uploded it to the GitHub.

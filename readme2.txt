## Project Description
Not having a strong visual grasp for the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a problem amongst programmers while designing a program. Additionally, designing and coding object structures takes a significant amount of time. We wish to eliminate the workload between said design and code implementation parts while also making programmers’ lives by making the design process easier to comprehend via visual programming elements. Users can create and modify the templates for classes’ properties, constructors and methods just by interacting with customizable GUI elements. The program will also allow the users to arrange and show the interactions between class trees and hierarchies. Hopefully, the program will prove itself useful for a range of programmers from beginner to intermediate. The tool will also be of interest to lecturers, instructors and students; it is going to be easier to teach with the visualization of concepts.

CURRENT STATUS OF THE PROJECT 
Project provides the main function that we desire which is extracting the uml diagram to a code, but there are little bugs when removing class and change relations between classes and interfaces.


WHAT HAS BEEN DONE( WHAT WORKS AND WHAT ISN'T)(WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE)
Main functions of the program has been implemented and works with some bugs.
A more convenient visual design can be implemented.
Some bug-fixing remains to be done.

Elif Zeynep Soytorun: I used Eclipse 4.6.0 with JavaFX (eclipse-neon). JavaFX library was used on project and is implemented to both project and eclipse. I used Eclipse for compiling and running project, with JDK 8. I worked on both the logic and gui parts of the project. First in the designing and planning, then coding classes for the logic part. I then learned JavaFX and helped code the gui parts. I've worked on the calculations about the lines and the lines' triangles.
Emre Tarakçı: I used Eclipse 4.6.0 with JavaFX (eclipse-neon). JavaFX library was used on project and is implemented to both project and eclipse. I used Eclipse for compiling and running project, with JDK 8. I've worked on multiple aspects of the project, such as the visual design of the code before writing, implementation of the designed codes and working on the communication between the classes, design and implementation process of GUI elements. I've worked on mathematical calculations in the background as well. I've searched for useful programs on the web as well, and found a java code called "Resize" which was later implemented to our program as a basis for the GUI.
Murat Kaan Özbaş: I used Eclipse 4.6.0 with JavaFX (eclipse-neon). JavaFX library was used on project and is implemented to both project and eclipse. I used Eclipse for compiling and running project, with JDK 8. Mostly worked on GUI parts of the project except for most DGeneralClass methods and some help on the design. I mostly got involved with Menu controls and synchronization between the representation and the DObject attributes, especially on control or update methods and learned JavaFX to implement them as necessary.
Osman Serhat Yılmaz: I used IntelliJ 2020.1.1 with JavaFX. JavaFX library was used on project and is implemented to project. I used IntelliJ for compiling and running project, with JDK 8. I worked on both logic and gui part and I usually made the menu options and edited the functions of it. Also I designed the ComplexLine object and removing and adding point functions. I made many researches for internet resources and solved many problems by looking StackOverflow  and found different example classes to implement our code properly.
Özgür Abi: I used Eclipse 4.6.0 with JavaFX (eclipse-neon). JavaFX library was used on project and is implemented to both project and eclipse. I used Eclipse for compiling and running project, with JDK 8. I primarily worked on logic part, especially object sources and class designs. I also worked on basics of GUI classes and connections between logic and GUI. I worked on project saving and loading methods. I also worked on Menu options and their connections with project system. I provided designs for GUI and logic classes.
Sefer Giray Şenel: I used Eclipse 4.6.0 with JavaFX (eclipse-neon). JavaFX library was used on project and is implemented to both project and eclipse. I used Eclipse for compiling and running project, with JDK 8. I worked on basics of logic part, especially object source classes. I primarily worked on GUI classes, especially on arrow and line connections. I also worked on menu windows and designed them.

## Project Description
Not having a strong visual grasp for the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a problem amongst programmers while designing a program. Additionally, designing and coding object structures takes a significant amount of time. We wish to eliminate the workload between said design and code implementation parts while also making programmers’ lives by making the design process easier to comprehend via visual programming elements. Users can create and modify the templates for classes’ properties, constructors and methods just by interacting with customizable GUI elements. The program will also allow the users to arrange and show the interactions between class trees and hierarchies. Hopefully, the program will prove itself useful for a range of programmers from beginner to intermediate. The tool will also be of interest to lecturers, instructors and students; it is going to be easier to teach with the visualization of concepts.
